The weather analysis provided useful information for the W.Avy regarding his potential green light for the Ice cream surfs shop. The temperatures look acceptable for both June and December, however the rainfall might have an affect on the shop. Rain typically keeps people away from the beach and thus away from the shop. The mean for rainfall is higher in December than June. With the slightly colder temperatures and more rain, I would suggest opening the shop fewer days during the week to account for the rain and lack of customers.
